== Abstract
The paper proposes the Consensus Augmented
 Lagrange Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (Consensus ALADIN) algorithm, a novel approach for solving dis
tributed consensus optimization problems (DC). Consensus
 ALADIN allows each agent to independently solve its own
 nonlinear programming problem while coordinating with
 other agents by solving a consensus quadratic program
ming (QP) problem. Building on this, we propose Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) Consensus ALADIN, a
 communication-and-computation-efficient Consensus ALADIN.
 BFGS Consensus ALADIN improves communication efficiency
 through BFGS approximation techniques and enhances compu
tational efficiency by deriving a closed form for the consensus
 QP problem. Additionally, by replacing the BFGS approxi
mation with a scaled identity matrix, we develop Reduced
 Consensus ALADIN, a more computationally efficient variant.
 We establish the convergence theory for Consensus ALADIN
 and demonstrate its effectiveness through application to a non
convex sensor allocation problem.
