== Abstract
This paper is about computationally tractable
methods for power system parameter estimation and Optimal
Experiment Design (OED). The main motivation of OED is
to increase the accuracy of power system parameter estimates
for a given number of batches. One issue in OED, however,
is that solving the OED problem for larger power grids turns
out to be computationally expensive and, in many cases, computationally intractable. Therefore, the present paper proposes
three numerical approximation techniques, which increase the
computational tractability of OED for power systems. These
approximation techniques are benchmarked on a 5-bus and a
14-bus case studies.
