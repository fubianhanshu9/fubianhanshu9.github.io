<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper investigates algorithms for solving distributed consensus optimization problems that are non-convex. Since
Typical ALADIN (Typical Augmented Lagrangian based Alternating Direction Inexact Newton Method, T-ALADIN for short) is a
well-performed algorithm treating distributed optimization problems that are non-convex, directly adopting T-ALADIN to those of
consensus is a natural approach. However, T-ALADIN typically results in high communication and computation overhead, which makes
such an approach far from efficient. In this paper, we propose a new variant of the ALADIN family, coined consensus ALADIN
(C-ALADIN for short). C-ALADIN inherits all the good properties of T-ALADIN, such as the local linear or super-linear convergence rate
and the local convergence guarantees for non-convex optimization problems; besides, C-ALADIN offers unique improvements in terms
of communication efficiency and computational efficiency. Moreover, C-ALADIN involves a reduced version, in comparison with
Consensus ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers), showing significant convergence performance, even without the
help of second-order information. We also propose a practical version of C-ALADIN, named FedALADIN, that seamlessly serves the
emerging federated learning applications, which expands the reach of our proposed C-ALADIN. We provide numerical experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of C-ALADIN. The results show that C-ALADIN has significant improvements in convergence
performance.
